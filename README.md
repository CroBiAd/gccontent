# gccontent

A JBrowse plugin for plotting GCContent. Consists of a storeClass that automatically calculates the percentage of G/C bases in a region, and a track type that automatically initializes the store (i.e. you actually just supply a staticchunked or fasta/indexedfasta store in the track config)
